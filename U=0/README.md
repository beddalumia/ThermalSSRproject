## Two-site entanglement in noninteracting lattice systems

#### Gaussian density matrices (for two-site subsystems)

`RDM0` implements the Peschel-Chung-Eisler theorem [1,2,3] for evaluating
the reduced density matrix of a free fermion system. It encapsulates the
Wick contractions in a simple, closed one-to-one expression, relating the
Entanglement Hamiltonian $H_\mathrm{E}$ to the one-body correlation matrix $G$: 

$$
H_\mathrm{E}^\intercal = \log((1-G)*G^{-1})
$$

Then the reduced density matrix $\rho$ is just given as 

$$
\rho = \mathrm{e}^{-\tilde{H}_\mathrm{E}}
$$

where $\tilde{H}_\mathrm{E}$ is the many-body representation of the single
body operator $H_\mathrm{E}$. To evaluate in an efficient way this, we precompute the Slater-Condon overlaps (single-body excitations between all
the given Fock states) with the included `slater_condon` function.

Overall, the Peschel-Chung-Eisler formulation is known to be very efficient
for computing reduced density matrices for small-enough subsystems, whereas it introduced nontrivial numerical issues for large ones (the $G$ matrix becomes singular, as all eigenvalues become very close to either $1$ or $0$) [3]. As we are interested in two-site RDMs, the issue does not touch us at all, leading to a reliable, semi-analytical treatment of the noninteracting models.


#### Superselected negativities

We implement the superselection of the two-site negativity in `ssr_negativity`, which depends on `partial_transpose`. The full fermionic negativity is computed by `negativity`. 


#### Superselected relative entropies

We provide, for benchmark, implementations of the superselected relative entropy of entanglement, as introduced in [4]. They are computed in `ssr_ree`.

#### Other utilities

The `build_ket`, `print_basis` functions are some small utilities used by the other main scripts. `name_to_be_decided.jl` is the script handling the data to build the final published figures. 

#### Replication of known results for a 1D chain

`Test1D` provides a replication of the results published in [5] for the superselected entanglement of a noninteracting tight-binding chain. Not only we reproduce exactly the analytical results for the superselected relative entropy (left panel), but we also retrieve the same main message with the newly proposed superselected negativity (right panel).

Albeit not identical in quantitative details ---as, for instance, the position of the local maximum for the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) entanglement--- the superselected negativities match exactly the critical doping for the sudden death of entanglement.

#### Thermal death of entanglement in the noninteracting chain

On the same model, we explore the evolution of superselected negativities and relative entropies, to find a thermal death of entanglement, at different fillings. For the negativity only, we are able to evaluate also the full ("non-superselected") entanglement (calling the provided `negativity` function), to confirm that the thermal death can only be witnessed under parity or charge superselection rules. See the associated paper for further details.

To verify that also the NNN full entanglement does not vanish at any displayed temperature, we re-plot the last figures in log-scale.

#### Data format

All the data generated by the scripts is stored in the `data/` subfolder, in CSV files. `*_fillings.csv` files store the given $\eta$ values and `*_tempereatures.csv` the temperatures, in units of th ehopping ($T/t$). `*_distances.csv` store the manhattan distances between the two selected sites in the lattice. 

The files `Thermal1D_PPTfull_d%d_f%f.csv`, `Thermal1D_PPTpSSR_d%d_f%f.csv` and
`Thermal1D_PPTnSSR_d%d_f%f.csv` store the logarithmic negativies, respectively with no-, parity- and charge-superselection rules, at the given distance (d) and filling (f), as a function of temperature.    

Similarly, `Thermal1D_REEpSSR_d%d_f%f.csv` and
`Thermal1D_REEnSSR_d%d_f%f.csv` store the
corresponding relative entropies of entanglement. 

Finally, 
`Test1D_PPTpSSR_d%d.csv`,
`Test1D_PPTnSSR_d%d.csv`,
`Test1D_REEpSSR_d%d.csv` and
`Test1D_REEnSSR_d%d.csv` store analogous data for the ground state benchmark, as a function of the filling $\eta$.
